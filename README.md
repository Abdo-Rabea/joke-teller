1. Click the **"Tell Me a Joke"** button
2. The app fetches a random joke from an API like [JokeAPI.dev](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/)
3. It uses the Text-to-speech (TTS) API -[Voice RSS](https://www.voicerss.org/api/)- to get the audio.
4. The button disables while reading, and re-enables after the joke is done.
